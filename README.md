**Data-Professional-Survey-Dashboard**

**Project Overview**
Comprehensive Data Analysis: Developed an end-to-end Power BI solution to analyze a global survey of 630 data professionals, uncovering trends in compensation, job satisfaction, and demographics.

Advanced Data Cleaning (ETL): Utilized Power Query to transform messy survey metadata into a clean, star-schema-ready dataset, handling varied entries for job titles and country names.

**Technical Features**
Multi-Visual Storytelling: Integrated a variety of advanced visualizations including TreeMap for education hierarchy, Gauge charts for sentiment analysis (Happiness scores), and Donut charts for gender distribution.

Dynamic KPI Tracking: Built high-level cards to display critical metrics such as Average Salary (53.36), Average Age (29.87), and the total number of programming languages tracked (6).

Salary Benchmarking: Engineered a horizontal bar chart to compare average salaries by role, identifying Data Scientists as the highest-paid segment in the dataset.

**Insights from the Dashboard**
Demographic Reach: The United States represents the largest respondent group (261 professionals), followed by India (73) and the UK (40).

**Work-Life Balance**: Captured a sentiment score of 5.86/10 for Work-Life Happiness, providing a baseline for workplace culture analysis.

**Gender Parity**: The data shows a nearly even split in participation, with 51.14% Female and 48.86% Male respondents.

**Education Trends**: Visualized the correlation between higher education (Masters/PhD) and job roles across different geographical regions.
